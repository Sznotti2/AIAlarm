# AIAlarm

This is an alarm clock for Android that will not let you snooze or sleep back by having a conversation with you. 
You can choose from many NPC's each with a unique personality and voice. (The voices are either originals or are cloned from someone e.g. Marge Simpson.) 
You will be asked to do certain tasks answer questions all with the aim of getting you uot of bed.

This is my first ever repository. If you have any suggestion or idea about the project please let me know.

## It is far from being done yet, may not even run on your machine. My plan is to regularly update the project while learning android developement.


(planned) Functionalities of AIAlarm 1.0.0:

	Working app with no errors, glithces, anomalies
	Clean interface
 	Clean code
	At least 1 NPC with you can have a conversation
